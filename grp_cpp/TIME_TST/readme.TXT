Compilation Instructions for Time Test Programs

General compilation instructions for this program are the same
as others except that ONLY clock.hpp and clock.cpp are needed
from the COMMON directory.

The initial timing mode is usually set to TIMEINTERNAL. This
doesn't really test anything but is a good check of proper
compiler and file configuration.
