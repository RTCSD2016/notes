Instructions for building "time_op"

This is a time/operator interface test program. It does not use all of the
"common" files. To build this program copy all of the files from this directory
(time_op) and the following files from the "common" directory:

clock.cpp
clock.hpp
oper_int.hpp
oper_int.cpp
base_obj.hpp
base_obj.cpp
compvonv.hpp

Then follow the same build procedures as for other programs.
